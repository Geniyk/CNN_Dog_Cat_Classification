## Overview

This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** to solve a binary classification problem – distinguishing between cat and dog images.  

The workflow included:  
- Importing and organizing datasets from Google Drive  
- Preprocessing images (resizing, normalization)  
- Designing and training a CNN model  
- Evaluating accuracy and visualizing predictions

## Business Problem

Image classification is a fundamental task in Computer Vision. The challenge is to **train a robust CNN model** that can accurately classify new images of cats and dogs despite variations in:  

- Image quality  
- Lighting conditions  
- Pose & orientation of animals  

**Objective:** Build an accurate and generalizable model for binary image classification.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Mounted dataset from Google Drive  
- Organized images into `train` and `test` folders  
- Preprocessing steps:  
  - Resized images to uniform dimensions (e.g., 128x128)  
  - Normalized pixel values to [0,1]  
  - Converted images into NumPy arrays  



## Model Architecture

CNN Model built using **Keras Sequential API**:  

- **Conv2D + ReLU Activation**  
- **MaxPooling2D**  
- **Dropout (to reduce overfitting)**  
- **Flatten layer**  
- **Dense (Fully Connected Layer)**  
- **Output Layer:** Sigmoid activation (binary classification)  



## Training & Evaluation

- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy  
- **Batch Size:** 32  
- **Epochs:** Tuned for convergence  

Evaluation performed on test dataset with confusion matrix and accuracy score.  



## Results & Key Findings

- Achieved **high test accuracy (>90%)** on Cats vs Dogs dataset  
- Model successfully generalized to unseen test images  
- Visual predictions confirmed CNN’s capability to differentiate cats and dogs  



## Final Recommendations

- Use **Data Augmentation** (rotation, zoom, flips) for robustness  
- Apply **Transfer Learning** (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) for better accuracy  
- Deploy trained model as a **web app / mobile app** for real-world usage  
- Extend project to **multi-class classification** (different pet species)
